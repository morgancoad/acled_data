# Data

The following dataset was obtained from [acleddata.com] which collects real-time data on the locations, dates, actors, fatalities, and types of all reported political violence and protest events around the world. ACLED has historic data dating back to 1997, however this analysis is focused on data from the last 3 years(Sep2019-Sep2022). ACLED catgorizes their data into sic types of events and twenty-five sub-events. You can access the documentation for the data at the following link.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

My first objective when analyzing this dataset was to identify the quanitative change of the amount of protests each year by country. This would depict whether there was an upward or downward trend in protests occuring. To find if there is a relationship between social media usage and a protest occuring I will look for a second data set that breaks down social media usage by country and platforms used. Finally I will explore the sub-events of the Protest event to identify the types of protests happening.
